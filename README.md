# Marae game
DISCLAIMER : This information is accurate for the Te Ati Awa tribe of Wellington and Taranaki.

PERL DISCLAIMER : This game is build with perl 5.32.0, to the best of my knowledge 5.32.1 doesn't support ANSI color codes. If anybody knows how to make ANSI colors work in perl 5.32.1, please contact me (details on main page) or make a pull request with your changes.

## Running this game
Clone the repo and run `make` or `make run`. The Makefile is built to run with `gmake`, but it should work with anything else.
